### Requirements
Python 3.8+

### Installation
```shell
$ pip3 install backendpy
```
Or use the following command to install optional additional libraries:
```shell
$ pip3 install backendpy[full]
```
You also need to install an ASGI server such as Uvicorn, Hypercorn or Daphne:
```shell
$ pip3 install uvicorn
```
### Quick Start
#### Create Project

*project/main.py*
```python
from backendpy import Backendpy

bp = Backendpy()
```

#### Create Application

*project/apps/hello/main.py*
```python
from backendpy.app import App
from .handlers import routes

app = App(
    routes=[routes])
```
*project/apps/hello/handlers.py*
```python
from backendpy.router import Routes
from backendpy.response import Text

routes = Routes()

@routes.get(r'^/hello-world$')
async def hello(request):
    return Text('Hello World!')
```

#### Activate Application

*project/config.ini*
```ini
[apps]
active =
    project.apps.hello
```

#### Run Project

Inside the project root path:
```shell
$ uvicorn main:bp
```

### Command line
#### Project creation
```shell
$ backendpy create_project --name myproject
```
To create a project with more complete sample components:
```shell
$ backendpy create_project --name myproject --full
```
#### App creation
```shell
$ backendpy create_app --name myapp
```
```shell
$ backendpy create_app --name myapp --full
```

Introduction
============
**Backendpy** is an open-source framework for building the back-end of web projects with the Python programming language.

Why Backendpy?
--------------
This framework does not deprive developers of their freedom by restricting them to pre-defined structures, nor does it leave some repetitive and time-consuming tasks to the developer.

Some of the features of Backendpy are:

* Asynchronous programming (ASGI-based projects)
* Application-based architecture and the ability to install third-party applications in a project
* Support of middlewares for different layers such as Application, Handler, Request or Response
* Supports events and hooks
* Data handler classes, including validators and filters to automatically apply to request input data
* Supports a variety of responses including JSON, HTML, file and… with various settings such as stream, gzip and…
* Router with the ability to define urls as Python decorator or as separate files
* Application-specific error codes
* Optional default database layer by the Sqlalchemy async ORM with management of sessions for the scope of each request
* Optional default templating layer by the Jinja template engine
* …

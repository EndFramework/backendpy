":class:`~backendpy.Backendpy` class instance of the current project (that"

"scope of the project can be accessed through the app field of each "

"information. Also, if we want to put information in the App context, this"
" information can be saved or read from ``request.app.context``. The data "
"stored in the App context is valid until the service is stopped. For "

"operations. The scope of the data stored in the request context is the "
"request itself and until it responds."

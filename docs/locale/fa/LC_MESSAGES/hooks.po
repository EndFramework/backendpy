"Sometimes it is necessary to perform a specific operation following an "
"event. For these types of needs, we can use Backendpy hooks feature. For "
"example, when we want to write an email management application that sends"
" an email after certain events in other applications, such as the "
"registration or login of users."

"for these events to run, or we can assign codes to execute when "
